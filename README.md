# Smart-Home-Temperrature-Prediction-Smart-Internz-
In this project we will just take the data that is generated by the sensors by The University of
CEU Cardenal Herrera (CEU-UCH)-Spain. We will preprocess the data and pass it to the
Regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random forest, LightGDBM, and Xgboost.
We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this best model is selected and
saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration and IBM deployment
